Welcome to the world of Superheros!

Superhero wiki is a place where everyone can share information Superheros!

The website is designed for superhero enthusists, who get tired of all the incorrect information out there that they can not change or delete!

The user can add, edit, delete, change back to older versions of any superhero!

With this application, the user has all the power!!

To start with you will need to install some gems!

1)HTTParty-for API calls
2)redcarpet-for markdown language
3)sinatra-the web application framework used

Need to sign up for the following API's
1)SendGrid-make an account and use your username for api_user and password for api_key whenever there is a HTTParty call to SendGrid.  Two places in lib/methods.rb and once in the server code.

Under schema.sql, you have the information needed for PostgreSQL.  
Then run the server and start adding superheros!!
